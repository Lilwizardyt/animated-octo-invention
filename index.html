            <h1>How to open console</h1>
            <h3>you can usually do CTRL-ALT-O to make it visible. Or through menus using View->Output. You can run your program by: Debug -> Start Without Debugging . It will keep a console opened after the program will be finished.</h3>
            <h3>A console window opens and closes immediately. You are not even able to read the Hello World. In e.g. Visual Studio Code (or other IDEs like e.g. Eclipse) console applications are running on a console integrated in the IDE. When the app has finished, the output is still visible.</h3>
